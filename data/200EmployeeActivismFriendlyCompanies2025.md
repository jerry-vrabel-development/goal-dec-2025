2. **Check:** Has the company faced organizing? How did they respond?
3. **Glassdoor:** Look for reviews mentioning freedom to speak up
4. **LinkedIn:** Connect with current employees, ask about culture
5. **News:** Search for recent labor actions or employee protests
6. **Union databases:** Check if company has union presence

### Interview Questions to Ask
- "How does the company handle internal disagreement or dissent?"
- "Have employees successfully advocated for changes here?"
- "What channels exist for employee voice?"
- "How does leadership respond to employee concerns?"
- "Are there employee resource groups or representation?"
- "What's the company's stance on unionization?"
- (Be strategic about how directly you ask these)

### During Offer Stage
- Review employee handbook sections on speech/organizing
- Check if there are non-disparagement clauses
- Ask about channels for raising concerns
- Understand grievance procedures

## Important Disclaimers

### This List Is Imperfect
- **Employee voice varies** by department, location, manager
- **Company cultures change** with leadership, acquisitions, economic conditions
- **What's documented publicly** ≠ complete picture
- **Union presence** doesn't automatically mean worker-friendly
- **Non-union** doesn't mean employees lack voice
- **Tech company activism** can focus on specific issues (contracts, ethics) not broader workers' rights

### Not All Activism Is Equal
- Some companies tolerate **certain types** of activism (climate, diversity) but not others (labor organizing, pay)
- **External activism** (social issues) vs. **internal activism** (working conditions) may be treated differently
- **High-skilled workers** often have more latitude than low-wage workers
- **Public-facing companies** may be more sensitive to employee voice due to PR

### Context Matters
- **2025 political climate** has made some companies more cautious
- **Economic uncertainty** can reduce tolerance for disruption
- **Industry norms** vary dramatically
- **State labor laws** affect organizing rights
- **Company size** impacts organizing dynamics
